# autoremind-bot

This is a Telegram bot, that will remind you about various important things you tell him.

Of course, scheduled messages in Telegram do the same thing. However, they don't do that periodically,
and you have to type in reminder again.

This bot approaches it clever way, and allows you to set periods to your reminders.
Then bot will autoremind you all the time, until you decide to stop it.
